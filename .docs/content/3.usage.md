# Usage

You can run permanent process which will generate and publish tweets in random moments during day:

Build project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run process:

```bash
npm run start
```

Keep in mind that you need to authorize with OAuth. For that go to `http://localhost:3000/auth` and follow instructions. Reminder about authorization will be also displayed in terminal.

> As OAuth token is stored in MongoDB you need to authorize only once and it will also work in different scripts.

## Scripts

You also can configure some cron jobs to run scripts in specific moments of day.

Before configuring cron jobs you need to authorize in Twitter with OAuth. For that run `npm run auth` and go to `http://localhost:3000/auth`.

```bash
npm run auth
```

`publish-post` - generates and publishes tweet:

```bash
npm run publish-post
```

`publish-post-random` - generates and publishes tweet with probability defined by `CHANCE` environment variable:

```bash
npm run publish-post-random
```
